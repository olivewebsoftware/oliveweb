        <h1 id="header">Welcome to OliveWeb's Official Discord Server!</h1>
        <h1 id="header">This is a server to talk about OliveWeb's products, and <br>
        suggest some new software as well!</h1>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">But, like every other Discord server, there are some rules <br>
        you have to follow as well:</h1>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">1. No spamming</h1>
        <p id="desc">Spamming will result in a mute or kick, but it depends <br>
        how much you do it.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">2. No malware</h1>
        <p id="desc">Spreading malware is a violation of the OliveWeb TOS. <br>
        This will lead to a permanent ban with no appeals.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">3. Be kind</h1>
        <p id="desc">We don't want you to be mean, so you'll just get muted <br>
        for 10 minutes for being rude but the time may increase <br>
        depending on how you are.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">4. Don't be annoying</h1>
        <p id="desc">Please don't annoy members on the server with annoying <br>
        things. Doing this a lot can get you kicked from the server.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">5. No asking stupid questions</h1>
        <p id="desc">For example: "Can you release a free Bitcoin miner?" <br>
        Questions are welcome, just don't ask stupid ones over and <br>
        over again.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">6. TOS Violations</h1>
        <p id="desc">If you are caught violating the OliveWeb TOS, your account <br>
        will get immediately with no appeals.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 id="header">If you need any help with OliveWeb software or with the server <br>
        itself, contact us at customer-support.</h1>
