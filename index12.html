        Type the name of your app, what your developer name is in the email window. <br>
    IMPORTANT! After pressing 'Submit', an email window will pop up. <br>
Do not edit anything in the subject of this email. In the body part of <br>
the email, attach a ZIP file containing all of your app files. Also, you can <br>
include anything else you would like us to know about your app. Make sure <br>
the app is an HTML file. Thank you for submitting an app to us and making <br>
your app usable by everyone.</p>
<br>
<p id="desc2">In the email, include these items: <br>
1. Name of app <br>
2. Developer of app <br>
3. ZIP file containing all the files for the app (the app itself must be written in html) <br>

We will scan the file for viruses once we recieve it. There is no fee for submitting apps, and you can<br>
submit as many as you want. Apps may take up to 48 hours to get onto the store. If your app gets onto the <br>
store, we will publish it and let you know that your app was published onto the store. If it was not, we will <br>
let you know that it wasn't published and tell you why. If you have any questions, please contact our support! <br>
